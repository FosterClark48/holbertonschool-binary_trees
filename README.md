# Binary Trees
## Objectives
- What is a binary tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- what are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## General requirements
- Global variables are not allowed
- C standard library is allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Header file should be called `binary_trees.h`
- Typedef data structures provided: `binary_tree_t`

## Data Structures to Use for Project
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
